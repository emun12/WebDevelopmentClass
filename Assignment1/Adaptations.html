                 In the <i>Clash of the Titans</i> and <i>Wrath of the Titans</i> movies, Posideon is portrayed as a greek god.
                 He is one of the supporting characters of the movie and his role is to give the main character, Perseus who is a demi-god, his iconic trident.
                 This trident will later help the main character defeat Kronos, an evil titan.

            <p>
               In the popular series, <i>Percy Jackson & the Olympians</i>, Posiedon is portrayed as the father to the main character, Percy Jackson.
               Percy Jackson is a demi-god, or the child of a human and god. Percy Jackson develops powers that are similar to Poseidon's in that he can talk
               to sea animals and also control water. Posiedon is potrayed as one of the many greek gods that have refused to claim their children, leading to
               many battles between other monsters, gods, and demi-gods. Poseidon is just seen as one of the many gods that are powerful but also selfish.
